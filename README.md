### Guard Retention
#### Vol 1
1 Guard retention system
  - **General System**
    - **Offensive Cycle**
      - Strong mechanical connection to my oponent (hands and feet) to enable to break his balance and attack from bottom and prevent my oponent to create angle or distance to pass my guard
      - If iam strongly connected to my oponent, when he moves, i also move.
    - **Defensive Cycle**
      - When oponent break the strong mechanical connection
    - ***Confuse defensive and offencive cycles is a common error***
    - ***Heuristic rather than algorithmic***
    - **Key components**
      - **3 Physical skill sets**
        - **Posture Skills**
          - Seated, supine, turtle
          - Maintain knees to chest and elbows to knees
        - **Movements Skills**
          - Pommelling (move foots and hips in circles, back/front),
          - scissoring,
          - hip heisting (levantada tecnica),
          - back heisting (fuga com proteção + raspagem),
          - rolling,
          - sitting (sentar/repor a partir da tartaruga),
          - inverting,
          - shrimping (fuga e avanço de quadril),
          - scooting,
          - propping
        - **Framing Skills**
          - Forehand, Forearm, Back hand
      - **3 Tactical Skills**
        - **Threat assessment**
          - **Demarcation Line Theory**
            - Body Lines  
        - **Appropriate Reaction**
          - **5 Requirements Theory**
            - Grip, angle, close distance, change levels, pin
        - **Finish every sequence**
          - **In offensive cycle**
      - ***Unforced Error Avoidance***
        - **Common errors**
          - Chest and head exposure
    - ***Summary***
      - **1** Identify threat based on demarcation lines and 5 requirements of guard passing
      - **2** React with appropriate level of response using frames & body movement
      - **3** Recover centerline alignment and legs
      - **4** Ever  finish in an offensive cycle
  - **Specific Moves**
    - **6 most prevalent and effective guard passes**
      - **1** Double under
      - **2** Over / under
      - **3** Toreando
      - **4** Leg Drag
      - **5** Knee slice
      - **6** Long step pass
    - **6 Conditions to guard pass**
      - **1** Break mechanical connection (less than 4 points of contact)
      - **2** Grip work
      - **3** Close distance
      - **4** Angle
      - **5** Level change
      - **6** Finish pin
    - **Demarcation Lines**
      - **1** Toe
      - **2** Knee and hips (mantain knee above hips, dont extend legs
      - **3** Shoulder
      - **Center line** ever be in center line - dont allow opponent stays on the side
      - **Interception point** Side x hip line (side of hip point)
      - Dont allow oponent control (with knee/hand) on the interception point
    - **Framing ranges**
      - Arms length (using hand) - Can use to retain and go to scizor guard
      - Half arms length (using elbows and forearms)
      - No arms length (using backhand)
      - Use gi grips to framing (cross collar is a good idea)
