### Guard Retention
#### Vol 1
- **Guard retention system**
  - **General System**
    - **Offensive Cycle**
      - Strong mechanical connection to my oponent (hands and feet) to enable to break his balance and attack from bottom and prevent my oponent to create angle or distance to pass my guard
      - If iam strongly connected to my oponent, when he moves, i also move.
    - **Defensive Cycle**
      - When oponent break the strong mechanical connection
    - ***Heuristic rather than algorithmic***
    - **5 Conditions**
      - Oponent grip the pants -> break or deny
      - Oponent slide angle -> realign your center
      - Oponent get closer to critical point (lateral of hips) -> frame (forehand) / scizor/ hip heist
      - Oponent starts level changing -> frame (forearm) / hip heist / scizor 
      - Oponent pin one shoulder -> frame (backhand) / hip heist / scizor / power prop (46:00 vol 5)
    - **Key components**
      - **3 Physical skill sets**
        - **Posture Skills**
          - Seated, supine, turtle
          - Maintain knees to chest and elbows to knees
        - **Movements Skills**
          - **Seated**
            - Rolling Inversion (4:40 vol 3, important detail 7:00)
            - Scooting (2:22 vol 3)
            - Hip Heist (9:44 vol 3, levantada tecnica)
          - **Supine**
            - Shrimping (15:50 vol 3, 21:09 vol 3 important detail, fuga de quadril)
            - Pommelling (22:20 vol 3, move foots and hips in circles, back/front)
            - Pendulum (26:28 vol 3)
            - Scissoring (29:39 vol 3)
            - Spinning Inversion (35:00 vol 3)
            - Back Heist (41:00 vol 3, fuga com proteção)
          - **Turtle**
            - Shoulder Roll (45:45 vol 3)
            - Sitting (53:35 vol 3)
        - **Framing Skills**
          - Forehand, Forearm, Back hand (one hand in chest and other in the ear, to get the biceps, 16:33 vol 4)
          - Frames on yourself (23:33 vol 4)
          - Dont push when framing, just control to use your legs
          - Drill frame and guard (crossing legs)
       - **Breaking & Negating**
         - Maintain shoulders toward hips to oponent cant push you back
         - Break grips in pants and engage grips upper body (29:00 vol 4)
      - **3 Tactical Skills**
        - **Threat assessment**
          - **Demarcation Line Theory**
            - Body Lines  
        - **Appropriate Reaction**
          - **5 Requirements Theory**
            - Grip, angle, close distance, change levels, pin
        - **Finish every sequence in offensive cycle**
        - **Common errors**
          - Chest and head exposure
    - ***Summary***
      - **1** Identify threat based on demarcation lines and 5 requirements of guard passing
      - **2** React with appropriate level of response using frames & body movement
      - **3** Recover centerline alignment and legs
      - **4** Ever finish in an offensive cycle
  - **Specific Moves**
    - **6 most prevalent and effective guard passes**
      - **1** Double under
      - **2** Over / under
      - **3** Toreando
      - **4** Leg Drag
      - **5** Knee slice
      - **6** Long step pass
    - **6 Conditions to guard pass**
      - **1** Break mechanical connection (less than 4 points of contact)
      - **2** Grip work
      - **3** Close distance
      - **4** Angle
      - **5** Level change
      - **6** Finish pin
    - **Demarcation Lines**
      - **1** Toe
      - **2** Knee and hips (mantain knee above hips, dont extend legs
      - **3** Shoulder
      - **Center line** ever be in center line - dont allow opponent stays on the side
      - **Interception point** Side x hip line (side of hip point)
      - Dont allow oponent control (with knee/hand) on the interception point
    - **Framing ranges**
      - Arms length (using hand) - Can use to retain and go to scizor guard
      - Half arms length (using elbows and forearms)
      - No arms length (using backhand)
      - Use gi grips to framing (cross collar is a good idea)
#### Vol 2
- **2 Most basic requirements of guard retention**
  - Movement
  - Connection
- **The unforgivable sin of guard retention**
  - Chest exposure
- **The 3 postures of guard retention**
  - Sitting (square and steaded)
  - Supine
  - Turtle
  - Example: 27:52 - Sit, back on the floor, supine position, escape with hips, turtle position, front flip to guard
#### Vol 3  


### Pratices
Sit, back on the floor, supine position, escape with hips, turtle position, front flip to guard (27:52 vol 2)
